# NebulaOS Terminal
When using NebulaOS, I recommend using the following terminal emulators based on your system:
<br />
1. OSX: [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
2. Windows: [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)
3. Linux: [Konsole](https://konsole.kde.org/)
<br />
<br />
## Other terminals
To check if a terminal can use NebulaOS, please use the following command:
<br />
```printf "\x1b[38;2;255;100;0mTRUECOLOR\x1b[0m\n"```
<br />
This is a basic truecolor test. It should print 'TRUECOLOR' in a brown color. Sometimes you will have to set environment variables to make it work.
<br />
<br />
The terminals listed above are the best options I have found for NebulaOS, although feel free to add recommendations in a request.
